# OSUTrade

This project is intended to create a website for Oregon State University students to trade used items.

## Features

### Frontend

- picture, product name, price

### Backend

- Use OSU account to login
- upload pictures => 3D

## Inspiration



## What it does

A secondhand trading platform for OSU students to trade used items. The website allows students to upload pictures of their items, and other students can browse and purchase them.


- it calls backend api to show all products at home page
- prduct details page contains google map (trading location), 3D model 

## How we built it

Next.js fullstack application. The backend is designed following the principles of clean architecture. The interface adapter layer (controller, repository), use case layer (service), and entity layer (model) have been created to make the backend easy to test and extend in the future.

## Challenges we ran into

- no time, no money

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

It may not be easily noticeable in a demo or by the user, but with clean architecture, we can easily add new features and write tests in the future.

## What we learned

- more familiar with Next.js framework, clean architecture
